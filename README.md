### <a id="logistic-regression">Logistic Regression</a>
Logistic Regression â€“ is an algorithm for Binary Classification. Example: Input Image has some animal, output is 1 if it is a bird and 0 if it is not. Logistic Regression uses sigmoid function as an activation function in order to keep output between 0 and 1. Here we will build **Logistic Regression Classifier** to recognize birds.

<br/>

#### <a id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</a>
From Cifar-10 dataset we will take images with birds and non-birds. We will mark birds with label 1 (y=1) and others with 0 (y=0). We will divide dataset for training subset and testing subset. Finally, we will build **Simple Image-Recognition Algorithm** for classification pictures as birds or non-birds. No "for" loops will be used.

<br/>

#### <a id="general-algorithm">General algorithm</a>
General algorithm is as following:
* Initializing parameters
* Calculating Cost Function and its Gradient
* Using an optimizational algorithm for updating parameters (Gradient Descent)

### <a id="flatten-prepared-datsets">Flatten prepared datsets</a>
For convenience we will reshape images of shape (32, 32, 3) into numpy array of shape (3072, 1).
<br/>By using '-1' we say that number of column is unknown, but number of rows is known.
<br/>By using '.T' we're transposing each image and making their data arranged in columns.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:
<br/>(related file: [Logistic_Regression.py](https://github.com/sichkar-valentyn/Neural_Networks_for_Computer_Vision/blob/master/Codes/Logistic_Regression/Logistic_Regression.py))

```py
x_train_flatten = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], -1).T
y_train_columns = y_train.reshape(1, y_train.shape[0])
x_test_flatten = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], -1).T
y_test_columns = y_test.reshape(1, y_test.shape[0])

print(x_train_flatten.shape)
print(y_train_columns.shape)
print(x_test_flatten.shape)
print(y_test_columns.shape)

# (3072, 1900)
# (1, 1900)
# (3072, 164)
# (1, 164)
